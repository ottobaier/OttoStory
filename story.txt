Mona's life was turned upside-down the day she was bitten by a radioactive moth.
I know what you're thinking--'Moths don't bite.'
But this one did.
Mothman had his time in the spotlight, but now it's Mothwoman's time to shine.

When night fell, Mona was inexplicably drawn to the lights outside. Before she knew what she was doing, she found herself in the middle of the road staring down an 18 wheeler. Without thinking she jumped and found herself flying over the city. "How am I flying?!" Mona asked herself. Then she saw that she had wings.

Immediately after that, Mona found her wings are illusion.
She actually did not have wings.
after two seconds, she died.
