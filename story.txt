Mona's life was turned upside-down the day she was bitten by a radioactive moth.
I know what you're thinking--'Moths don't bite.'
But this one did.
Mothman had his time in the spotlight, but now it's Mothwoman's time to shine.

When night fell, Mona was inexplicably drawn to the lights outside. Before she knew what she was doing, she found herself in the middle of the road staring down an 18 wheeler. Without thinking she jumped and found herself flying over the city. "How am I flying?!" Mona asked herself. Then she saw that she had wings.

Immediately after that, Mona found her wings are illusion.
She actually did not have wings.
after two seconds, she died.

But she did not pass on to the afterlife.
Mona survived as a ghost.
Now she lives only to haunt Mothman, for she knows he planted the illusion of her having wings.

Being a young ghost, Mona's haunting method of choice was through text message.
	UNKNOWN: Come to the old lighthouse at midnight.
	YOU(mothman): uhhh who is this
	UNKNOWN: I am the one who will turn YOUR world upside-down! I am Mothwoman!!
	YOU: uhhhhmm sorry i have a boyfriend :/
